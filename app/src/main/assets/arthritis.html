<h2>Diet</h2>
<p>Practitioners believe the following dietary habits may cause or worsen the symptoms of RA:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>drinking alcohol</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>eating spicy foods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>taking in excess salt</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>consuming too many sour, sweet, or sugary foods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>eating uncooked foods</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>eating foods that cause&nbsp;<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146619.php">acid reflux</a></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, an Ayurvedic practitioner will recommend avoiding these foods.</p>
<p>Some Ayurvedic practitioners also recommend soups that contain&nbsp;barley and rice, as these are thought to add a sense of lightness to the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a practitioner may recommend a castor oil fast. This is when a person consumes castor oil, a natural laxative, to encourage intestinal purification.</p>
<p>Over several days, a person will reintroduce foods and ultimately progress to a healthful routine diet.</p>
<p>Exercise and lifestyle</p>
<p>Ayurvedic practitioners believe that positive lifestyle habits can support RA treatment.</p>
<p>They believe that a sedentary lifestyle leads to the formation of &ldquo;ama,&rdquo; which causes inflammation and disease.<br>Practicing yoga, an essential part of Ayurvedic medicine, can help a person with RA to be more active and also reduce stiffness and pain.<br>Ayurvedic practitioners may recommend the following tips for people with RA:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>using hot water, not cold, to bathe in and drink</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>avoiding exposure to cold breezes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>avoiding late-night or late-afternoon naps</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>practicing yoga to relieve mental stress</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>using massage therapy with herbal oils to reduce pain and stiffness</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>While Ayurvedic practitioners do believe that physical activity can help relieve some conditions, they recommend that people with RA avoid excess walking.</p>
