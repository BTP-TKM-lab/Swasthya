<p>Complications of allopathic treatment</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The treatment of acute gout allopathically blocks the inflammatory response with Colchicine, NSAIDs, and intraarticular steroids.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>When prescribing NSAIDs to the elderly, extreme caution should be exercised.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, uncontrolled hypertension, and cardiac failure are not recommended for patients taking these medications.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Patients with gastrointestinal disorders may have difficulty taking Colchicine, as it can reach toxic levels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The drugs may also damage the bone marrow and the kidneys in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Intravenous Colchicine can result in myelosuppression, hepatic necrosis, seizures, renal failure, and death.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Side effects of corticosteroids include glucose intolerance, electrolyte shifts, increased susceptibility to infection and hypertension.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Allopathic drugs that increase urate</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A decrease in urate excretion by the kidneys and diuretics and aspirin to control hypertension and impaired renal function are important risk factors among the elderly.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There were six patients with high blood pressure, two of whom took antihypertensive medications.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Taking such drugs worsens gout symptoms, and alternative antihypertensive treatments should be considered for these patients.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
