<p>Ayurvedic Herbal Treatments - A safe and effective treatment alternative</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Ayurveda offers many herbal treatments for the treatment of OA. These herbs have documented antiinflammatory properties without the side effects of commonly prescribed medications.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The herbs boswellia, turmeric, ashwagandha, ginger, triphala, guggulu, and shatavari have all been shown to decrease inflammation by interfering with the production of inflammatory chemicals in the body.</p>

<p>Ayurvedic Herbs</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>SAMe</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is a naturally occurring molecule found in the body. It acts as a pain reliever, has anti-inflammatory properties, and may stimulate cartilage growth. It lowers pain levels and improved mobility in people with osteoarthritis as effectively as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A typical dosage is 200-400 milligrams (mg) three times a day. You shouldn&rsquo;t take more than 1,200 mg per day.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Avoid taking this herb if you have:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>bipolar disorder</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Lesch-Nyhan syndrome</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t take SAMe if you&rsquo;re taking:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>antidepressant drugs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and duloxetine (Cymbalta)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>cold medications, such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>levodopa (Stalevo)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>meperidine (Demerol)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>pentazocine (Talwin)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>tramadol (Ultram)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p>Capsaicin</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Capsaicin is the heat-producing active ingredient in chili peppers. It is thought to ease arthritis-related pain. Capsaicin causes a pain transmitter called substance P to be released and depleted. Regular use prevents substance P from building up again.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>It is moderately effective in easing osteoarthritis pain when used topically four times per day. It&rsquo;s considered safe to use for up to 20 weeks on various parts of the body.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You should get a topical cream, gel, or patch that contains up to a 0.075 percent concentration of capsaicin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Always do a small skin patch test before use to check for possible allergies. Mild burning and irritation may occur. If you don&rsquo;t have more severe irritation within 24 hours, it should be safe to apply elsewhere. Avoid eyes and sensitive skin.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t use capsaicin if you take any medications containing zucapsaicin or if you take any antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p>Fish oil</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The omega-3s in fish oil may improve symptoms of arthritis by blocking substances that cause inflammation and converting them into anti-inflammatory chemicals. Fish oil is also said to reduce pain and joint tenderness.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Fish oil is thought to be more effective because it contains high levels of EPA and DHA, which have anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Take fish oil capsules with EPA or DHA concentrations of at least 30 percent.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A typical dosage is up to 500 mg per day. You shouldn&rsquo;t exceed this dose.</p>
