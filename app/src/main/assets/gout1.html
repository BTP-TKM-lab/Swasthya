<p>Patient education:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>One approach to gout treatment is patient education.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Hyperuricemia is more common with current lifestyle trends (increasing lack of exercise, excess weight).&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>A study in the United States found that only 25% of gout patients who received ULT were aware that the medication would be used chronically. Only 12% of them knew that starting ULT could worsen gout in the short term.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Resting the joint:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>A systematic review showed that correct rest for the joint could also contribute to treating an acute gout flare.&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The affected joint should be raised, and keep the joint cool &ndash; apply an ice pack wrapped around in a cloth for up to 20 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>do not put pressure on the paining joint.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Dietary recommendations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Overweight patients should aim for a normal weight but should not crash-diet or follow protein-rich diets such as the Atkins diet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reduced-fat foods and vegetarian sources of protein should be integrated into the diet.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Protein-rich foods such as meat, offal, crustaceans, and yeast should be avoided.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Patients known to suffer from gout and kidney stones should be instructed to consume sufficient fluids (&gt;2 L /day).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Consumption of alcohol, particularly beer and spirits, should be reduced. Patients should be encouraged to refrain from consuming alcohol for at least 3 days per week.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Sugar-sweetened beverages should be avoided. One study showed that consumption of soft drinks and drinks containing fructose entailed an increased risk of a gout flare. Fructose inhibits uric acid excretion by the kidneys.</p>
    </li>
